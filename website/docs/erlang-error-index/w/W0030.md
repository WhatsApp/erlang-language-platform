# W0030 - `maps:put/3` usage rather than dedicated syntax

## Warning

```erlang
main(K, V, Map) ->
    maps:put(K, V, Map).
%%  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^💡 information: Consider using map syntax rather than a function call.
```

## Explanation

The warning message indicates that a key-value is being inserted into a map
using the `maps:put/3` function call rather than the dedicated syntax.

Whilst this will correctly and unconditionally insert the key-value into the
map, it is not considered idiomatic, and may be less efficient than using
the map update syntax directly.

If the keys are constants known at compile-time, using the map update syntax
with the `=>` operator is more efficient than multiple calls to `maps:put/3`,
especially for small maps. This implies than using the `=>` operator should
make future additions to the code both more performant and more clear.

To fix the issue, use the built-in `Map#{Key => Value}` syntax to insert the
`Key` and `Value` into the `Map`:

```erlang
main(K, V, Map) ->
    Map#{K => V}.
```

*Note:* Use the `:=` operator instead, for performance and code clarity, if
the key should already exist in the `Map`.
