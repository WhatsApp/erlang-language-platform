# W0037 - Unspecific include

## Weak Warning

```erlang
-include("some_header_from_app_a.hrl").
%%       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 💡 weak: Unspecific include.
```

becomes

```erlang
-include_lib("app_a/include/some_header_from_app_a.hrl").
```

## Explanation

This weak warning is raised when an `-include` or `-include_lib` directive uses a bare filename (e.g., `"some_header.hrl"`) without a path, and the included file comes from a **different application**. This scenario is possible when using a build tool such as buck2.

### Why this matters

Using bare filenames in includes can lead to:

- **Ambiguity**: Multiple applications might have header files with the same name, making it unclear which file is being included.
- **Fragile builds**: The include resolution depends on the include path configuration, which can vary between build environments.
- **Reduced readability**: Developers cannot immediately see which application provides the header file.

### When this diagnostic fires

The diagnostic is raised when:

1. The include path does not contain a `/` (i.e., it's a bare filename)
2. The included file is from a **different application** than the source file
3. The included file is in an `include/` directory (not in a `src/` directory)
