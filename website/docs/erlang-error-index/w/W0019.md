# W0019 - Expression can be simplified

## Warning

```erlang
-module(main).
foo(X) ->
  bar([] ++ [1]).
%% ^^^^^^^^^ ðŸ’¡ warning: Can be simplified to `[1]`.
```

## Explanation

The warning indicates that an expression can be trivially simplified to a more
concise form without changing its behavior. This diagnostic helps improve code
readability and can be especially useful during code refactoring and
optimization.

## Supported Simplifications

### List Operations

- **Append with empty list**: `[] ++ X` â†’ `X` and `X ++ []` â†’ `X`
- **Subtract with empty list**: `[] -- X` â†’ `[]` and `X -- []` â†’ `X`

### Arithmetic Operations

- **Addition with zero**: `0 + X` â†’ `X` and `X + 0` â†’ `X`
- **Subtraction with zero**: `0 - X` â†’ `-X` and `X - 0` â†’ `X`
- **Multiplication by one**: `1 * X` â†’ `X` and `X * 1` â†’ `X`
- **Division by one**: `X div 1` â†’ `X`
- **Remainder by one**: `X rem 1` â†’ `0`

### Boolean Operations

- **Short-circuit evaluation**: `true andalso X` â†’ `X` and `false orelse X` â†’
  `X`
- **Negation of literals**: `not true` â†’ `false` and `not false` â†’ `true`

### Note on Macros

This diagnostic does not apply to expressions that involve macro expansions, as
simplifying them might change the intended behavior or readability of the code.
