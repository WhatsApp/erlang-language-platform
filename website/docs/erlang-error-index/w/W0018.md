# W0018 - Unexpected semicolon or dot

## Warning

```erlang
-module(main).
foo(1)->2;
foo(2)->3.
      %% ^ warning: Unexpected '.'
foo(3)->4.
```

```erlang
-module(main).
foo(1)->2;
foo(2)->3;
      %% ^ warning: Unexpected ';'
```

## Explanation

The warning message indicates that there is an unexpected separator in a
function clause sequence. This diagnostic is generated when:

1. **Unexpected dot (`.`)** - A dot appears where a semicolon is expected
   between function clauses
2. **Unexpected semicolon (`;`)** - A semicolon appears where a dot is expected
   at the end of a function definition

In Erlang, function clauses within the same function must be separated by
semicolons (`;`), and the final clause of a function must end with a dot (`.`).

### Correct Pattern:

```erlang
function_name(Pattern1) -> Expression1;
function_name(Pattern2) -> Expression2;
function_name(Pattern3) -> Expression3.
```

To fix this error, replace the incorrect separator with the appropriate one:

- Use semicolons (`;`) between function clauses of the same function
- Use a dot (`.`) only after the final clause of a function
