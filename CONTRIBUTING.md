# Contributing to Erlang Language Platform

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## Our Development Process

ELP is currently developed in Meta's internal repositories and then exported
out to GitHub by a Meta team member; however, we invite you to submit pull
requests as described below.

## Developing Locally

The gold standard is the current config in [ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

You can find detailed instructions on how to compile ELP from source [here](./website/docs/get-started/install.md).

## Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes and that the code is formatted correctly (`cargo fmt -- --check`)
4. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

## Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")

In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need
