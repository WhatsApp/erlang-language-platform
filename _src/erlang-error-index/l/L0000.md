# L0000 - Issue in Included File

## Error

```erlang
//- /include/first.hrl
  -include("second_typo.hrl").  %% Typo in filename

//- /src/main.erl
  -module(main).
  -include("first.hrl").
%%^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ error: L0000: Issue in included file
%%                     | Related info: E1516: can't find include file "second_typo.hrl"
```

## Explanation

This diagnostic is reported at an `-include` or `-include_lib` directive when there is an error in the included file (or in a file transitively included by it).

The L0000 code itself is a "wrapper" diagnostic that points to the include directive in the source file. The actual error details are provided as related information, showing the specific issue that occurred in the included file.

Common causes include:
- Missing or misspelled include files referenced from the included header
- Syntax errors in the included file
- Undefined macros or other compilation errors in the included file

## Resolution

1. Check the related information to see the actual error that occurred
2. Navigate to the included file and fix the underlying issue
3. If the error is a missing include file, verify the file exists and the path is correct
4. If the error is in a transitively included file, follow the include chain to locate and fix the issue

This diagnostic helps track errors that originate in header files back to the point where the include directive appears in your source file.
