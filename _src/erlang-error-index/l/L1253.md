# L1253 - Redefine record

## Error

```erlang
    -record(person, {name, age}).
    -record(person, {name, age, city}).
%%  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ðŸ’¡ error: record person already defined
```

## Explanation

This error occurs when you attempt to define a record with the same name more
than once in the same module.

Each record name must be unique within a module. If you need to modify a record
definition, you should update the original definition rather than creating a new
one with the same name.

To fix this error, either:

1. Remove the duplicate record definition
2. Rename one of the records to have a different name
3. Combine the field definitions into a single record definition

```erlang
%% Correct approach - single record definition
-record(person, {name, age, city}).
```
