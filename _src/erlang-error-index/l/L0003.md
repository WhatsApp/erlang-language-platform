# L0003 - Unknown Application

## Error

```erlang
%% ^ Error: Unknown application elp(L0003) [Ln 1, Col 1]
```

## Explanation

This occurs when ELP tries to invoke the OTP Erlang Compiler on a
module, but cannot find application data for it in the ELP project
model.

This normally means a misconfiguration of the build information for
the project, or in rare cases a bug in ELP.

If the build information looks valid, please file a bug report.
