# W0039 - Macro Precedence Surprise

## Warning

```erlang
    -module(main).

    -define(MYOP(B,C), B + C).
    foo(A,B,C) -> A * ?MYOP(B,C).
     %%               ^^^^^^^^^^ ðŸ’¡ warning: The macro expansion can have unexpected precedence here
```

## Explanation

At the surface level, when writing a macro call, it looks like a
function call, and you have to look inside the macro to know what it
expands to (or hover).

This can lead to surprises if the top level of the macro is a bare
binary operation and it is used within another binary operation, as
the precedence can then escape.

The example above will end up being parsed as `(A * B) + C`, where at
first glance it might appear that it would be `A * (B + C)`.

This diagnostic reports where this occurs, and offers to add parens at
the macro call site, so leading to

```erlang
    foo(A,B,C) -> A * (?MYOP(B,C)).
```
