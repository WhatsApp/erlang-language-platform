# W0040 - Undocumented function

## Weak Warning

```erlang
    -module(main).
    -export([main/0]).

    main() -> ok.
 %% ^^^^ ðŸ’¡ weak: The funcion is exported, but not documented.
```

## Explanation

The function `main/0` is exported, but contains no documentation.

Documentation can be added using the `-doc` attribute, using the Markdown format:

```erlang
    -module(main).
    -export([main/0]).

    -doc """
    This is the documentation for the `main` function.
    """.
    main() -> ok.
```

It is recommended to add documentation to all exported functions,
so that it becomes available during auto-completion, hover, and other IDE features.

For functions that are not exported, but for which documentation is not desired, it is
possible to mark the function as `-doc hidden.` to silent the linter.

To disable the linter for all files belonging to a module, you can mark the entire module
as `-moduledoc hidden.`.

It is also possible to add metadata to the documentation. For more information, see
[the official Erlang documentation](https://www.erlang.org/doc/system/documentation.html#doc-metadata).
