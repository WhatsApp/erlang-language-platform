# W0054 - Do not suppress compiler warnings at module level

## Warning

```erlang
-module(example).

-compile([
    nowarn_shadow_vars,
%%  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ðŸ’¡ warning: Do not suppress compiler warnings at module level.
    nowarn_unused_vars
%%  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ðŸ’¡ warning: Do not suppress compiler warnings at module level.
]).
```

This diagnostic is triggered when a `-compile` attribute is used to suppress
compiler warnings with `nowarn_*` options.

Warning suppressions prevent the compiler from reporting issues that could
indicate problems in your code. Many of these warnings are indicating serious
problems that should be fixed rather than suppressed.

By addressing these issues directly rather than suppressing warnings, you'll
have a more maintainable codebase.
