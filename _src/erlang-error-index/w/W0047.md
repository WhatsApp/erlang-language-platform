# W0047 - Avoid explicit garbage collection

## Warning

```erlang
-module(main).
-export([warning/0]).

warning() ->
    erlang:garbage_collect().
%%  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ðŸ’¡ warning: Avoid forcing garbage collection.
```

## Explanation

Erlang manages dynamic memory with a _tracing garbage collector_. More precisely
a _per process generational semi-space copying collector_. More information
about the Erlang garbage collector can be found in the
[official documentation](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/garbage_collection.html).

While garbage collection happens automatically, it can manually be triggered via
the `erlang:garbage_collect/0,1,2`. This function forces an immediate garbage
collection of the executing process. The function is not to be used unless it
has been noticed (or there are good reasons to suspect) that the spontaneous
garbage collection will occur too late or not at all. Improper use of this
function can seriously degrade the performance of the system.

Instead of forcing garbage collection, try to evaluate what creates a
significant amount of garbage which trickes into old heap (and is not collected
with minor runs). Refactor your Erlang code to either generate smaller amount of
garbage (this also helps with CPU). Start with making a test case reproducing
high GC.

If you are certain that explicit garbage collection is needed, you can use add
the following to silent this warning:

```
% elp:ignore W0047 (no_garbage_collect) - Explanation here
```
