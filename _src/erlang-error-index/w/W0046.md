# W0046 - Undocumented module

## Weak Warning

```erlang
-module(arith).
     %% ^^^^ weak: The module is not documented.
```

## Explanation

The current module is not documented and it should be documented via a
`-moduledoc` attribute (preferred) or a (deprecated) `%% @doc` comment.

At the top of an Erlang module, it is good practice to add an overview of the
module. The overview may include details on how to use the module API, some
examples of the different functions working together or a diagram.

Documentation can be written in Markdown, and it is possible to include diagrams
using the [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) syntax.

Documentation is usually made available in the form HTML pages generated by
[ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc). It is also used in the IDE in
features such as _hover_, _signature help_ and _auto-complete_.

If the module is part of an internal API, it is possible to silent the weak
warning by adding the following:

```erlang
-moduledoc false.
```

## Example

````erlang
-module(arith).
-moduledoc """
   A module for basic arithmetic.

   This module can be used to add and subtract values. For example:
   """.
   ```erlang
   1> arith:substract(arith:add(2, 3), 1).
   4
   ```
````
