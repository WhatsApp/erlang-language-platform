# W0036 - unnecessary Map From List Around Comprehension

## Warning

```erlang
fn(List) -> maps:from_list([{K + 1, V + 2} || {K,V} <- List]).
%%          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ðŸ’¡ weak: Unnecessary intermediate list allocated.
```

## Explanation

The warning message indicates an unidiomatic and sub-optimal way to build a map
from a list.

Whilst the comprehension and subsequent call to `maps:from_list/1` will ultimately
construct a map from the key-values pair in the given list, it is less
efficient than it could be, since an intermediate list is created by the list
comprehension.

Using the map comprehension syntax is clearer and more performant.

To fix this warning, replace the list comprehension and `maps:from_list/1` call
with a map comprehension:

```erlang
main(List) ->
    #{K + 1 => V + 2 || {K,V} <- List}.
```
