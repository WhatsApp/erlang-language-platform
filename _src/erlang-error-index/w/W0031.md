# W0031 - `maps:update/3` usage rather than dedicated syntax

## Warning

```erlang
main(K, V, Map) ->
    maps:update(K, V, Map).
%%  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ğŸ’¡ information: Consider using map syntax rather than a function call.
```

## Explanation

The warning message indicates that a key-value is being updated in a map
using the `maps:update/3` function call rather than the dedicated syntax.

Whilst this will correctly update the key-value into the map, it is not
considered idiomatic, and may be less efficient than using the map update
syntax directly.

If the keys are constants known at compile-time, using the map update syntax
with the `:=` operator is more efficient than multiple calls to `maps:update/3`,
especially for small maps. This implies than using the `:=` operator should
making future additions to the code also both performant and clear.

To fix the issue, use the built-in `Map#{Key := Value}` syntax to insert the
`Key` and `Value` into the `Map`:

```erlang
main(K, V, Map) ->
    Map#{K := V}.
```

*Note:* Use the `=>` operator instead, if the key may not already exist in
the `Map`.
