# W0041 - Usage of debugging function

## Error

```erlang
-module(main).
-export([main/0]).

main() ->
    re~dbug:start("io:format/2->return", []).
%%  ^^^^^^^^^^^^ ðŸ’¡ error: Debugging functions should only be used during local debugging and usages should not be checked in.
```

## Explanation

It is common to use debugging or tracing functions while troublehooting code locally.
These functions are usually not meant to be used in production code, but they can still be checked-in by mistake.

This linter raises an error when it detects the usage of a debugging function.

It is possible to silence a specific instance of this linter by prepending:

```
% elp:ignore W0041 - An optional explanation here
```
