# W0049 - Prefer `[{version, 2}]` when constructing a set

## Error

```erlang
-module(main).
foo() -> sets:new().
%%       ^^^^^^^^^^ ðŸ’¡ warning: Prefer `[{version, 2}]` when constructing a set.
```

## Explanation

Erlang/OTP 24.0 introduced a new internal representation for sets which is more
performant. Developers can use this new representation by passing the
`{version, 2}` flag to `new/1` and `from_list/2`, such as
`sets:new([{version, 2}]).` This new representation will become the default in
future Erlang/OTP versions. Functions that work on two sets, such as `union/2`
and similar, will work with sets of different versions. In such cases, there is
no guarantee about the version of the returned set. Explicit conversion from the
old version to the new one can be done with
`sets:from_list(sets:to_list(Old), [{version,2}])`.
