# W0023 - Risk of Atoms Exhaustion

## Error

```erlang
   -module(main).

   -export([do/0]).

   do() ->
     [binary_to_atom(<<I/integer>>) || I <- lists:seq(1, 100)].
   %% ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ðŸ’¡ error: Risk of atoms exhaustion.
```

## Explanation

Erlang atoms are not garbage-collected. Once an atom is created, it is never removed. The emulator terminates if the [configurable limit](https://www.erlang.org/doc/efficiency_guide/advanced#system-limits) for the number of atoms is reached.

Therefore, converting arbitrary input strings or binaries to atoms can be dangerous in a system that runs continuously. All functions which can create atoms have a _safe_ variant which should be favoured when possible:

| Conversion Function  | Safer Version                             |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `list_to_atom/1`     | `list_to_existing_atom/1`                 |
| `binary_to_atom/1,2` | `binary_to_existing_atom/1,2`             |
| `binaty_to_term/1,2` | `binary_to_term/2` with the `safe` option |

When using the _safe_ or _existing_ versions of the above conversion functions, all atoms **must have been created earlier** or the function will cause an exception:

```
1> binary_to_existing_atom(<<"this_atom_does_not_exist">>).
** exception error: bad argument
     in function  binary_to_existing_atom/1
        called as binary_to_existing_atom(<<"this_atom_does_not_exist">>)
        *** argument 1: not an already existing atom
```

To explicitly create necessary atoms beforehand, you can export a function that returns a list of all atoms which are expected:

```
-export([atoms/0]).
atoms() ->
  [my_atom, your_atom, our_atom].
```

If there is no way to know atom names in advance and there is **100% confidence in bounded string variations passed to the conversion function** you can preceed the conversion function call with a special comment to silent the linter:

```
% elp:ignore atoms_exhaustion - An optional explanation here
```
