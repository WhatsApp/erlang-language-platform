# W0042 - Equality check with unnecessary operator

## Warning

```erlang
fn(A, Same, Diff) ->
   case A =:= foo of
%%      ^^^^^^^^^💡 weak: Consider rewriting to an equality match.
     true -> Same;
     _ -> Diff
   end.
```

```erlang
fn(A, Same, Diff) ->
   case A =/= foo of
%%      ^^^^^^^^^💡 weak: Consider rewriting to an equality match.
     false -> Same;
     true -> Diff
   end.
```

```erlang
fn(A, Same, Diff) ->
   if A =:= foo -> Same;
%%    ^^^^^^^^^💡 weak: Consider rewriting to an equality match.
      true -> Diff
   end.
```

## Explanation

The warning message indicates an unidiomatic way to express a structural
equality check.

To fix this warning, replace the use of the `=:=` operator and subsequent
check of the result with a direct use of an equality pattern:

```erlang
fn(A, Same, Diff) ->
   case A of
     foo -> Same;
     _ -> Diff
   end.
```

## Notes

We *do not* offer rewrites where the pattern would end up being a bare variable.

For example, the following code is not rewritten:
```erlang
fn(A, B, Same, Diff) ->
   case A =:= B of
     true -> Same;
     _ -> Diff
   end.
```

Since the resulting pattern would be a bare variable, e.g. `B` in:

```erlang
fn(A, B, Same, Diff) ->
   case A of
     B -> Same;
     _ -> Diff
   end.
```

Subsequent refactorings might then rename `B`, changing the pattern from
an equality check to a new binding, with potentially subtle and confusing results.
We want to avoid introducing dangerous patterns like this.
