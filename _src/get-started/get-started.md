# Get Started

Designed at **WhatsApp** and inspired by the success of the
[Rust Analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) project, ELP provides **a
scalable, fully incremental, IDE-first library for the semantic analysis of
Erlang code**.

ELP includes a fully fledged **LSP language server for the Erlang programming
language**, providing advanced features such as go-to-definition, find references,
call hierarchy and more for your IDE of choice.

ELP is easily **extensible** and provides a convenient **API to implement linters and
refactoring tools for Erlang**.

In the following sections we explain how to get ELP up and running.
