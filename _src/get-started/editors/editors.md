# Configure Your Editor

The ELP project can be used as a [language server](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/overviews/lsp/overview/) with text editors and IDEs which adhere to the LSP protocol. The list of supported editors include Emacs, Vim, VS Code, Sublime Text 3 and more.

These pages contain all the information needed to configure your favourite text editor or IDE to use ELP as a language server.
